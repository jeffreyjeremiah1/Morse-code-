# Morse Code

This python project involves implementing a program that can translate strings of text into Morse code and decode Morse code back into text. The program could use a dictionary to map the letters of the alphabet and other characters to their corresponding Morse code sequences and vice versa.

To encode text into Morse code, the program could take a string as input and iterate over the characters in the string, looking up the corresponding Morse code sequence in the dictionary and adding it to the output string. To decode Morse code, the program could take a string of Morse code as input and split it into individual code sequences. It could then iterate over the code sequences, looking up the corresponding letter or character in the dictionary and adding it to the output string.
